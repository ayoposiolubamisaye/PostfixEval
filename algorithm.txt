1. Create stack class
2.Import java util stack
3.create a public boolean method,char at parameter, that returns if the operator value from user input is true (mult, div, add, sub)
4. create a public int method to evaluate postfix, with a string expression as a parameter
Create stack constructor for integer values
loop through string of characters
a. create a public boolean method that returns if stack is empty or not
if operator scanned is a number, it will be pushed to the stack
otherwise if the scanned character is an operator it pop two integers from the stack, and it is applied to the operator
if the operator is + it will add the two values popped and pushes them to the stack, this is likewise for multiplication ,division, and subtraction only
it breaks after each case
at the end of the loop it pops the stack which should be a single int value
5. Make sure the value entered can only be +,-,/ and *, it prompts the user to give valid input if invalid and numbers must be integers or an exception will occur and prompt user to give another response
6. Continuing the main method, it instantiates constructor and then outputs the method from the valid user input.
7. In the while loop it keeps asking user for input unless they type 'Quit'.
